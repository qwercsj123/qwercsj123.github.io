      <div class="c-paragraph"> In the fields of healthcare and medicine research, the fusion of Artificial Intelligence
        (AI) and Data
        Science (DS) has brought unprecedented innovation to this traditional domain. This integration has
        demonstrated its potential in multiple aspects, including but not limited to medical imaging analysis,
        diagnostic decision support, drug discovery, and personalized healthcare. Utilizing AI and DS, the healthcare
        field has achieved significant advancements in enhancing diagnostic accuracy and treatment efficiency. Despite
        the promising outlook, "AI and Data Science for Healthcare" still faces several key gaps and challenges in
        realizing its full potential:
      </div>
      <div class="c-s-title">Importance of Data-Centric AI (DCAI).</div>
      <div class="c-paragraph">
        Traditionally, the development of AI has focused on optimizing model design to accommodate fixed datasets, often
        overlooking inherent data flaws such as missing values, incorrect labels, and outliers. This situation raises a
        critical issue: whether improvements in various model performances genuinely reflect the model's actual
        potential or merely result from overfitting the datasets. Medical professionals and researchers typically
        emphasize the importance of large-scale, high-quality datasets for generating reliable and broadly applicable
        medical insights, highlighting the necessity of implementing Data-Centric AI (DCAI).
      </div>
      <div class="c-s-title">Advancing People-Centric Healthcare (PCHC).</div>
      <div class="c-paragraph">Although advancements in AI and DS have provided people with more access to healthcare
        information, these
        technologies have not sufficiently encouraged active people participation. Existing healthcare information
        systems lack interactivity and user-friendliness, restricting people's ability to proactively track, manage,
        and share their healthcare data. Therefore, developing interactive and user-friendly people-centric AI
        technologies and providing corresponding data education and support are crucial for realizing People-Centric
        Healthcare (PCHC).
      </div>
      <div class="c-s-title">Promoting PCHC through DCAI Integration.</div>
      <div class="c-paragraph">A lack of interoperability among healthcare IT systems and a unified standard for data
        exchange limits the
        effective use of Data-Centric AI in People-Centric Healthcare. The diversity of data formats and standards
        impedes data sharing and analysis, restricting the ability to provide comprehensive and coordinated care. To
        promote the effective merger of Data-Centric AI and People-Centric Healthcare, there is an urgent need to
        develop and adopt unified data standards. Effectively integrating data from various sources, including
        clinical data, people-provided information, and real-time healthcare monitoring data, to support personalized
        medicine remains a significant challenge.
      </div>
      <div class="c-s-title">Facilitating DCAI with Insights from PCHC.</div>
      <div class="c-paragraph">AI models have shown tremendous potential in improving the accuracy of medical diagnoses
        and treatment
        decisions. However, these models are often seen as "black boxes" with insufficient explainability, which poses
        a barrier to building trust in AI-driven decisions among people and healthcare providers. Enhancing the
        explainability of models and ensuring that both people and medical professionals can understand the
        recommendations made by AI is crucial for advancing people-centric AI applications.
      </div>
      <div class="c-paragraph">The overarching goal of this workshop is to grow the AI/DS for Healthcare/Medicine
        communities and bridge
        these gaps.
        We aim to discuss scientific advances and thoughtful views generated from collaboration between healthcare
        professionals and experts from the fields of artificial intelligence and data science, further promoting the
        integration and development of DCAI and PCHC. We especially focus on efforts that have the potential to
        translate the value of healthcare data for the benefit of people's healthcare and the population's well-being.
        We believe the above topics have a broad audience across the entire SIGKDD research community.
